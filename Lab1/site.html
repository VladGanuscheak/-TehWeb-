  <p> Much of the history of computer language design during the 1960s traces its history to the ALGOL 60 language. ALGOL was developed during the 1950s with the explicit goal to be able to clearly describe algorithms. It included a number of features for structured programming that remain common in languages to this day.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Pascal is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth"><b><i>Niklaus Wirth</i></b></a> in the early 1970s.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Pascal was influenced by the ALGOL W efforts, with the explicit goals of producing a language that would be efficient both in the compiler and at run-time, allow for the development of well-structured programs, and to be useful for teaching students structured programming. A generation of students used Pascal as an introductory language in undergraduate courses. One of the early successes for language was the introduction of UCSD Pascal, a version that ran on a custom operating system that could be ported to different platforms. A key platform was the Apple II, where it saw widespread use. This led to the use of Pascal becoming the primary high-level language used for development in the Apple Lisa, and later, the Macintosh. Parts of the original Macintosh operating system were hand-translated into Motorola 68000 assembly language from the Pascal sources.</p>

  <p> What is known today as Delphi started with Turbo Pascal programming language, originally introduced by Borland as an IDE which allowed programmers to quickly write code with fewer errors. This feature was adopted and further developed into the Object Pascal language, an object-oriented programming language which allows for intuitive data modeling, data integrity, and reusability across distributed systems. Eventually, Delphi was sold off to Embarcadero and has since then seen dramatic changes.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Despite its age, Delphi continues to do well, being used to develop enterprise solutions, Point-of-Sale (POS) systems, native applications for various platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS), and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. It remains a very popular programming language as it continues to evolve to better fit the technologies and requirements of today.</p>

  <p> C is a middle level programming language developed by <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie"><b><i>Dennis Ritchie</b></i></a> during the early 1970s while working at AT&T Bell Labs in USA. The objective of its development was in the context of the re-design of the UNIX operating system to enable it to be used on multiple computers.
   </p>
   <p></p>
   <p> UNIX had been designed in 1969 by Ken Thompson, who wrote the system in assembly language in a DEC PDP-7 computer. Thompson made improvements and added expansion to complete the system. Brian W. Kernighan named the system UNIX, mostly written in assembly code. However, besides assembler and FORTRAN, UNIX also included an interpreter for the programming language B.  This language B was now used for improving the UNIX system.  Being a high level language, B allowed much faster production of code than in assembly language. Still, B suffered from drawbacks as it did not understand data-types and did not provide the use of "structures".</p>
   <p></p>
   <p> These drawbacks became the driving force for Ritchie for development of a new programming language called C. He kept most of language B&apos;s syntax and added data-types and many other required changes. Eventually C was developed during 1971-73, containing both high-level functionality and the detailed features required to program an operating system. Hence, many of the UNIX components including UNIX kernel itself were eventually rewritten in C.</p>

   <b>Strong features:</b>
   <ul>
    <li> As a middle level language, C combines the features of both high level and low level languages. It can be used for low-level programming, such as scripting for drivers and kernels and it also supports functions of high level programming languages, such as scripting for software applications etc.</li>
    <li> C is a structured programming language which allows a complex program to be broken into simpler programs called functions. It also allows free movement of data across these functions.</li>
    <li> C language is case-sensitive.</li>
    <li> C is highly portable and is used for scripting system applications which form a major part of Windows, UNIX and Linux operating system.</li>
    <li> C is a general purpose programming language and can efficiently work on enterprise applications, games, graphics, and applications requiring calculations.</li>

  <p> The C++ programming language has a history going back to 1979, when <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup"><b><i>Bjarne Stroustrup</i></b></a> was doing work for his Ph.D. thesis. One of the languages Stroustrup had the opportunity to work with was a language called Simula, which as the name implies is a language primarily designed for simulations. The Simula 67 language - which was the variant that Stroustrup worked with - is regarded as the first language to support the object-oriented programming paradigm. Stroustrup found that this paradigm was very useful for software development, however the Simula language was far too slow for practical use. </p>
   <p></p>
   <p> Shortly thereafter, he began work on "C with Classes", which as the name implies was meant to be a superset of the C language. His goal was to add object-oriented programming into the C language, which was and still is a language well-respected for its portability without sacrificing speed or low-level functionality. His language included classes, basic inheritance, inlining, default function arguments, and strong type checking in addition to all the features of the C language.

  <p> In the late 1990s, Microsoft decided to create a language that would compete with Java. During this time, Java was the most common language, and its popularity was rising. Classic ASP had its place, but the software needed to create the product was a paid application. Java was used to create web applications, and it was preferred among developers who understood C and C++.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a managed code compiler system called Simple Managed C (SMC). In January 1999, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg"><b><i>Anders Hejlsberg</i></b></a> formed a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for "C-like Object Oriented Language". Microsoft had considered keeping the name "Cool" as the final name of the language, but chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.</p>

  <p> The first public release version of java came in 1991. It took around 18 months combined effort to develop and had a initial name as &quot;Oak&quot; which was renamed to Java in 1995, due to copyright issues.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> The core idea behind java was to develop a language that is platform-independent and can be used in various devices such as embedded software&apos;s for consumer electronic devices. C and C++ were quite inefficient for the purpose because they were platform dependent, as their programs have to be compiled for particular hardware before execution. Also, the compiled code was inefficient for other processors and it had to be recompiled. The team of 5 also called as Green Team began to work in developing a easier and efficient, portable and platform-independent language that could create a code which can run on variety of processors under differing environments. That&apos;s how JAVA began!</p>

  <p> After several years of work and arguments, the committee published the first Haskell Language Report in 1990. This was a major milestone: at last there was a common functional language around which the research community could unite.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> The language has grown in popularity ever since, despite an avowed aim to avoid success at all costs. There are several freely available implementations. The most commonly used is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, which has an interpreter (ghci) and a compiler (ghc). These form an integral part of the Haskell Platform.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Haskell is now widely used in teaching, research and industry. For instance, it&apos;s taught at several Scottish universities including Glasgow, Edinburgh and St Andrews. It has its own annual research conference, the ACM Haskell Symposium. And there are many industrial users, including at Facebook.</p>

  <p>
   <ul>
    <li> Haskell features lazy evaluation, pattern matching, list comprehension, type classes and type polymorphism. It is a purely functional language, which means that functions generally have no side effects. A distinct construct exists to represent side effects, orthogonal to the type of functions. A pure function can return a side effect that is subsequently executed, modeling the impure functions of other languages.</li>
    <li> Haskell has a strong, static type system based on Hindley&ndash;Milner type inference. Its principal innovation in this area is type classes, originally conceived as a principled way to add overloading to the language, but since finding many more uses.</li>
    <li> The construct that represents side effects is an example of a monad. Monads are a general framework that can model different kinds of computation, including error handling, nondeterminism, parsing and software transactional memory. Monads are defined as ordinary datatypes, but Haskell provides some syntactic sugar for their use.</li>
    <li> Haskell has an open, published specification, and multiple implementations exist. Its main implementation, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), is both an interpreter and native-code compiler that runs on most platforms. GHC is noted for its rich type system incorporating recent innovations such as generalized algebraic data types and type families. The Computer Language Benchmarks Game also highlights its high-performance implementation of concurrency and parallelism.</li>
    <li> An active, growing community exists around the language, and more than 5,400 third-party open-source libraries and tools are available in the online package repository Hackage.</li>
